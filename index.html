<!-- additions:
snake should not be able to move back upon itself (moves right then immediately left instead of up/down then left)
snake should spawn and respawn in the middle of the canvas (width / 2, height / 2) and apple should respawn randomly on death
snake should get faster every time an apple is eaten, currently using framerate for the speed 
apples should spawn over time as well as respawn after being eaten 
Adding a game over screen with a "continue" button or something like that so it doesn't start immediately (could use some kind of dialog: developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog for this)
Adding a leaderboard and storing the it in localhost (this will of course only show for each user's browser, but still a fun task to setup). Everytime the snake gets bigger you add a point and when they lose, you store it in localhost as a leaderboard and maybe you could have a button that would open a modal and show the list of their best scores.
