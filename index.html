<!-- additions:
snake should not be able to move back upon itself (moves right then immediately left instead of up/down then left)
snake should spawn and respawn in the middle of the canvas (width / 2, height / 2) and apple should respawn randomly on death
snake should get faster every time an apple is eaten, currently using framerate for the speed -->
